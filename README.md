Hello! Iâ€™m @Geckobia, a rising 10th grade student.
I'm into pretty much anything technology, but specifically cybersecurity and app development at the moment.

Languages I'm proficient in:
- Java
- Processing

Languages I'm familiar in:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Languages I am new to:
- Python
- Kotlin

Although I am a beginner, I hope to learn more!

I'm interested in any subject, but specifically the maths and sciences.

I am also quite experienced with software such as Adobe Photoshop or Canva.

When I'm not coding, you can find me creating digital art, playing volleyball, or dying in Hollow Knight.


A website will be coming soon ;)

Have a great day!
